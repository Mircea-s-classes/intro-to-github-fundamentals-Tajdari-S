# About Me & Course Reflection

## Course Reflection

### What I Learned
- **Git basics** like cloning, committing, and pushing.
- How to collaborate using *branches* and pull requests.
- Markdown tricks, such as inline code (`git status`) and tables.

### Still Confused About
1. When to prefer *forks* over branches in a team project.
2. How to resolve complex merge conflicts.
